# 🔧 How to Implement This Dashboard
Follow these steps to integrate the **Kids Chore & Reward Dashboard** into Home Assistant.

---

## 📌 Step 1: Install Custom Cards  
This dashboard requires **custom frontend cards** to function correctly.

1. **Open Home Assistant**
2. **Go to HACS → Frontend**
3. **Search and install the following cards:**
   - 🟢 **Mushroom Cards** (`custom:mushroom-template-card`)
   - 🟢 **Auto-Entities** (`custom:auto-entities`)
   - 🟢 **Mini Graph Card** (`custom:mini-graph-card`)
4. **Restart Home Assistant** to apply the changes.

---

## 📌 Step 2: Create a New Section Dashboard  
To keep the dashboard organized, create a **separate section for chore tracking**.  You can skip this step if you have an existing location you want to use.

1. **Go to Home Assistant → Settings → Dashboards**  
2. Click **"Create Dashboard"**  
3. **Enter a name** (e.g., `"Kids Chores"`)  
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## 📌 Step 3: Add the Kids Dashboard YAML  
1. **Open your new dashboard.**  
2. Click **"Edit Dashboard" → "Manage Dashboard" 
3. Click **"Add Card"** and select **"Manual"**  
4. **Copy and paste the Kids Chore Dashboard YAML** into the card.  

``` yaml


````

---

## 📌 Step 4: Find and Replace "Kidname"  
Since this YAML uses a **placeholder name**, update it to match your child's name.

1. **Find and replace all instances of:**  
   - `Kidname` → (e.g., `"Payton"`)  
   - `kidname` → (e.g., `"payton"`)  
   - `KIDNAME` → (e.g., `"PAYTON"`)  
2. Ensure **case-sensitive replacement** to avoid errors.  
3. Click **"Save"** to apply changes.  

Note - If you are using something other than "points" for tracking, you will also need to do a find / replace of all versions being sure to match case.

---

## 📌 Step 5: Add the Parent Dashboard YAML  
1. **Click "Add Card"** and select **"Manual"**  
2. **Copy and paste the Parent Chore Dashboard YAML** into the card.  

``` yaml


```


---

## 📌 Step 6: Find and Replace Again  
Since the parent dashboard also references `Kidname`, repeat the **find-and-replace** process. 

1. Replace **all instances** of:  
   - `Kidname`
   - `kidname`
   - `KIDNAME`
2. Click **"Save"** to apply changes.  

Note - If you are using something other than "points" for tracking, you will also need to do a find / replace of all versions being sure to match case.

---

## 🎯 Finalizing the Dashboard  
- 🚀 **Exit edit mode** and test the new chore tracking system!  
- ✅ Ensure **buttons update chore statuses correctly.**  
- 🛠 If any entities are missing, check **sensor and button names** in Developer Tools → States.
