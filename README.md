# 🔧 How to Implement This Dashboard
Follow these steps to quickly set up the **KidsChores Dashboard** in Home Assistant, including both the **Kids** and **Parent** sections.  

This approach creates a **complete dashboard** in one step. Once it’s set up, you can:  
- 📌 **Move individual cards** to different positions or dashboards.  
- 🛠️ **Customize the layout** to suit your needs.  
- 📝 **Extract specific sections** from the dashboard YAML if you prefer to use them individually or in other dashboards.  

If you’re comfortable working with YAML, you can review the dashboard code to **select and reuse any individual cards or sections** that fit your needs.  
---

## 📌 Step 1: Install Custom Cards  
This dashboard requires **custom frontend cards** to function correctly.

1. **Open Home Assistant**
2. **Go to HACS → Frontend**
3. **Search and install the following cards:**
   - 🟢 **Mushroom Cards** (`custom:mushroom-template-card`)
   - 🟢 **Auto-Entities** (`custom:auto-entities`)
   - 🟢 **Mini Graph Card** (`custom:mini-graph-card`)
4. **Restart Home Assistant** to apply the changes.

---

## 📌 Step 2: Create a New Section Dashboard  
To keep the dashboard organized, create a **separate section for chore tracking**.  You can skip this step if you have an existing location you want to use.

1. **Go to Home Assistant → Settings → Dashboards**  
2. Click **"Create Dashboard"**  
3. **Enter a name** (e.g., `"Kids Chores"`)  
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## 📌 Step 3: Add the Dashboard YAML  
1. **Open your new dashboard.**  
2. Click **"Edit Dashboard" → "Manage Dashboard" 
3. Click the **"Edit Pencil"** next to the view name and select **"Edit Yaml"**  
4. **Copy and paste the Kids Chore Dashboard YAML** into the view.

https://github.com/ccpk1/kidschores-ha-dashboard/blob/main/files/kc-dashboard.yaml

---

## 📌 Step 4: Find and Replace "Kidname"  
Since this YAML uses a **placeholder name**, update it to match your child's name.

1. **Find and replace all instances of:**  
   - `Kidname` → (e.g., `"Payton"`)  
   - `kidname` → (e.g., `"payton"`)  
2. Ensure **case-sensitive replacement** to avoid errors.  
3. Click **"Save"** to apply changes.  

Note - No longer required to change the "points" text, the new dashboard dynamically grabs the point label from the integration.

---

## 📌 Step 5: Add Required Helpers (UI Support)  
Currently, the KidsChores Dashboard requires a few **helpers** to support interactive features in the UI. These helpers enable functions such as chore selection and custom date adjustments. While these may be **temporary requirements**, they are necessary for full dashboard functionality at this time.  

You will need to add:  
- 📂 **input_select.kc_{kid}_chore_list** — For selecting individual chores.  
- 🗓️ **input_datetime.kc_ui_set_date_helper** — For setting custom due dates.  
- ⚙️ **Automation: kc_ui_set_date_on_hold** — Triggers date adjustments from the UI.  

📄 [**kc-dashboard-uihelpers.yaml**](https://github.com/ccpk1/kidschores-ha-dashboard/blob/main/files/kc-dashboard-uihelpers.yaml)  


---

## 🎯 Finalizing the Dashboard  
- 🚀 **Exit edit mode** and test the new chore tracking system!  
- ✅ Ensure **buttons update chore statuses correctly.**  
- 🛠 If any entities are missing, check **sensor and button names** in Developer Tools → States.
